# MBank-Project
The development project to ensure the successful deployment of the Loans application for MBank (name changed). The project scope and objectives:

1. Installation of the Loans application: This step involves the installation of the application on the client's server, ensuring that it is properly configured and ready for use.

2. Data migration: The application requires data to be migrated from CSV files provided by the client. This step involves importing the data into the Oracle database and verifying its accuracy and completeness.

3. Verification of migration outcome: After the data has been imported, it is necessary to validate the results and ensure that the data has been correctly migrated to the database. 

4. Testing of main procedures: Before the application is deployed to the production environment, it is important to thoroughly test the main procedures to ensure that they work as expected. 

5. Implementation of additional features: The project scope includes the implementation of privacy roles for employees, which will allow employees to access only the information that they need to do their jobs. 

Overall, this project is focused on the successful deployment of the Loans application for MBank, utilising an Oracle database and leveraging a batch script to automate key aspects of the setup and data loading process. 
The project is designed to ensure that the application is ready for use by the client. This is a repleca only!
